# “How Django is Made” talk

Given 2018-08-11 at PyCon Ghana, and 2019-02-19 at PyCon Namibia.

Plain HTML - read locally by opening the file or serving with e.g.
`python3 -m http.server`.


## Some improvements to be made

If I were to be presenting this talk again, I would:

* Give a bit more introduction to what Django is, to make it suitable for a
  general Python audience
* Talk about Django Girls
* Add more pictures of websites and logos so the slides would be more
  interesting to look at
